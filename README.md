## 📦 GitHub Pages Deployment

This project is configured for automatic deployment to GitHub Pages using GitHub Actions.

### Initial Setup Steps

**IMPORTANT**: Follow these steps in order to avoid the "Not Found" error:

1. **Enable GitHub Pages first**:
   - Go to your repository on GitHub
   - Navigate to **Settings** → **Pages**
   - Under "Build and deployment", select **GitHub Actions** as the source
   - Click **Save**

2. **Create the workflow file**:
   - Ensure the `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` file exists in your repository
   - If you're setting this up for the first time, commit and push the workflow file

3. **Trigger the deployment**:
   - Push to the `main` branch, or
   - Go to **Actions** tab and manually run the "Build and Deploy to GitHub Pages" workflow

4. **Verify deployment**:
   - Check the **Actions** tab for workflow status
   - Once successful, your site will be available at: `https://[username].github.io/[repository-name]/`

### Troubleshooting

If you encounter the "Not Found" error:
- Ensure GitHub Pages is enabled in repository settings **before** running the workflow
- Check that your repository is public, or you have GitHub Pro/Team for private repo Pages
- Verify the workflow has the correct permissions (already configured in the workflow file)

The GitHub Actions workflow will automatically:
- Install dependencies using Node.js 20
- Build the project with Vite
- Deploy the `dist` folder to GitHub Pages

### Internationalization

The app supports multiple languages:

## 🎨 Design System

The application uses a modern design system with:
- **Color Scheme**: Support for light and dark modes
